Important Note for Bonus Grass Assets
Thank you for using Veridian Imposters! This folder contains a few bonus grass billboard prefabs for you to use in your projects.

Please Note: The default scale of these prefabs is intentionally very large.

To meet the Unity Asset Store's submission guidelines, all prefabs must have a default Transform scale of (1, 1, 1). Because these grass billboards were generated from large imposters, their base size is significant.

How to Use Them Correctly
You will need to scale the prefabs down to a realistic size for your scene. Here are the two most common ways to do this:

1. For Manual Placement in a Scene:

If you are dragging the grass prefabs directly into your scene, simply adjust their scale in the Inspector.

Select the grass GameObject.

In the Transform component, change the Scale from (1, 1, 1) to a much smaller value.

A good starting point is (0.1, 0.1, 0.1). Adjust from there to fit the needs of your project.

2. For Use with the Unity Terrain System:

If you are adding the grass as a "Detail Mesh" to paint onto your terrain:

In the Terrain Inspector, go to the "Paint Details" tab.

Click "Edit Details..." > "Add Grass Texture" or "Add Detail Mesh".

When you add the grass prefab, you will see settings for Detail Width and Detail Height.

Set these values to a small number (e.g., 0.5 or 1) to scale the grass appropriately for your terrain.

We hope you find these bonus assets useful!
